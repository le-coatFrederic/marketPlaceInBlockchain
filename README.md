# Blockchain Simulator

This is a blockchain simulator that allows users to create and verify transactions, add new blocks to the chain, and verify the integrity of the entire chain. It is written in Java and uses a proof-of-work algorithm to simulate the mining process. This project is an exercise for our school.
